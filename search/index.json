Check for it with alias. alter user system identified by \"PASSWORD\"; alter user system account unlock; exit Note: \u0026quot;PASSWORD\u0026quot; needs to be replaced by a password of sufficient complexity. For example, the password used for this test was 22 characters long and included two capital letters, ten lowercase, eight numbers, and two special characters. Be sure to take note of the password used, it will be needed later. Collect report data\u0026nbsp;# mkdir /tmp/dbsat/reports cd /tmp/dbsat/reports bash /tmp/dbsat/dbsat collect -n system@${ORACLE_SID} \"${ORACLE_SID}_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\" Generate readable report\u0026nbsp;# bash /tmp/dbsat/dbsat report -n -a \"${ORACLE_SID}_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\" Note: The above command will only work if you are generating the .html report on the same day that the data was collected. Otherwise you will need to manually replace ${ORACLE_SID}_$(date +%Y-%m-%d) with the filename. Copy report to p-account home\u0026nbsp;# Change permissions of the .html report file chmod 777 \"${ORACLE_SID}_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_report.html\" exit cp /tmp/dbsat/reports/REPORT_NAME ~/wherever/you/want/ Note: Replace REPORT_NAME with the .html report filename and ~/wherever/you/want/ to the desired path within your home directory. Automation idea\u0026nbsp;# We may be able to script this process and run it on an OEM console to get reports for every database all at once.
